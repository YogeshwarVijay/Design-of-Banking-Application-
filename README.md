# Design-of-Banking-Application

Banking is an essential service for people of all ages, but especially for elderly people who may have limited mobility and access to financial resources. However, many banking applications are not designed with the needs and preferences of elderly users in mind, which may result in frustration, confusion, and low satisfaction. Hence, the main aim of our project is to exclusively design a “ user-friendly banking application for elderly people ” that can help them manage their finances easily and securely.

The project covers the following aspects:

Identifying the needs and behavior of elderly users when using banking applications.
Designing a mobile banking interface that suits the needs of elderly users.
Evaluating the interface design based on its acceptability, understandability, and ease of use for elderly users. The project is significant because it can contribute to improving the quality of life and financial inclusion of elderly people.
TECHNICAL ASPECTS

● Designing a user interface that is easy to read and interact with, considering the physical and cognitive limitations of the elderly, such as presbyopia, color vision problems, hand-eye coordination and motor skills.

● Providing clear and simple instructions, feedback and error messages, using language that is familiar and understandable for the elderly.

● Ensuring security and trust by using biometric recognition, such as face or fingerprint scanning, to eliminate the need for passwords or PINs.

● Supporting financial inclusion and literacy by providing information and education on how to use mobile banking and its benefits.

Key Features of Our Project:

● A user interface that is easy to read and interact with, considering the physical and cognitive limitations of the elderly.

● Improving the gestures and sensitivity of the app due to repeated touches of the application.

● Clear and simple instructions, feedback and error messages, using language that is familiar and understandable for the elderly.

● Security and trust features, such as biometric recognition, encryption and fraud alerts, to protect the personal and financial information of the elderly.

● Convenience, unlimited access and cost-effectiveness features, such as mobile check deposit, bill payments, loan payments and money transfers, to enable the elderly to perform various banking transactions without having to go to the bank to support financial inclusion and literacy for the elderly.
